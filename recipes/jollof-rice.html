    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. <br>
            Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder,<br>
            1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. <br>
            Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 <br>
            minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle <br>simmer;
            cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking<br>
            liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids. 
        </li><br>
        <li> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li><br>
        <li> Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the <br>
            juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into <br> the
            thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li><br>
        <li>
            Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook<br>
            1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add<br> 
            tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5<br>
            to 7 minutes. 
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt,<br>
            and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until<br>
            rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue<br>
            cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes. 
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. Add plantains<br>
            and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side.<br>
             Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with fried plantains and serve with<br>
             chicken. 
        </li>
    </ol>
